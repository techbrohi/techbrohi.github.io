Hello there, I'm Bazil Brohi from Karachi Pakistan seeking to log my journey of solving and meticulously studying CTF and Cybersecurity related machines here, 
in a strictly ordinal manner that follows from Beginner to Advanced, that can also be followed by a curious mind if it wishes to. 
You can also find more about various tool tinkerings, strategies to manage chaotic and disoriented cybersecurity study data into segregated compartments,
It's an appreciable journey, Nevertheless, Enjoy!
